I wrote my answers in a jupyter notebook and then converted it into a pdf file. This is why the answers might seem long. But when ignoring codes and outputs, the answers appear to be short and normal. I also included two pdf files, one with truncated outputs (Assessment.pdf), and a long one with full outputs. The truncated one deleted the outputs and a paragraph from the final question's answer, but this isn't a big issue. I also included the notebook so you can run the code yourself.

The code outputs are very useful, they contain calculations and statistics that I used and build my answers based on. So you might need to check the full version or open the notebook sometimes.

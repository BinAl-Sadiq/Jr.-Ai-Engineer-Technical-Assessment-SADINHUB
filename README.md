I wrote my answers in a jupyter notebook and then converted it into pdf. This is why the answers might seem long. But after when ignoring codes and outputs, the answers appear to be short and normal. I two pdf files, one with truncated outputs (Assessment.pdf), and a long one with full outputs. The truncated one deleted the outputs from the final question's answer, but this isn't a big issue. I also included the notebook so you can run the code yourself.
